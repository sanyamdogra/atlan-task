# s r t analysis

This is a project for solving the problem statement given by Atlan.  

Deployment Link : https://srt-analysis.netlify.com/

### Problem Statement

Wikipedia says, “Sachin Tendulkar is a former Indian cricketer, widely regarded to be the greatest cricketer of all time.”
Use the given data on Sachin Tendulkar's entire career to prove or disprove the given statement.

### My Solution
As I have applied for Frontend Engineering Internship at Atlan, I have tried to provide an Atlanish look and feel to it. I have tried to replicate the same color scheme.
I have used JS functions to calculate the stats and Recharts to visualize these results.
The frontend is made on React to draw a postive conclusion that Sachin is indeed the greatest cricketer of all time.

### Technologies Used

* Architecture used
    * MV Architecture
* Model
    * data.json: Converted the csv to json, for easier data manipulation.
    * functions.js: Containes all the functions used to extract info about Sachin from data.json.
* View
    * React JS: For view, or frontend side I have used ReactJS
    * [React-boostrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/): To consume minimal bootstrap components, I have used react-bootstrap.
    * [Recharts](http://recharts.org/): For visualization, I have used Recharts for graphs and pie charts.
    * [React-Select](https://react-select.com)): To use the best-in-class select component for React
    * [React-reveal](https://www.react-reveal.com/): To provide animations and smooth transitions.
